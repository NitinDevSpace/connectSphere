# 🖥️ Connect Sphere — Frontend (Client)

This is the **frontend** of the **Connect Sphere** project — a modern, responsive social media web application built with **React.js** and **Vite**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The client provides a dynamic and intuitive interface for users to:
- View, create, edit, and delete posts  
- Upload and preview images or videos  
- React to posts (like, love, etc.)  
- View real-time updates in the feed  
- Interact with the backend REST APIs securely  

The application communicates with the backend running on port **8080**, while the client runs locally on port **5173**.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **React.js** — Component-based UI framework  
- **Vite** — Fast build and development tool  
- **Axios** — For API communication  
- **React Router** — Client-side routing  
- **CSS / Modern UI libraries** — For responsive styling

## ⚙️ Running Locally

1. Navigate to the client folder:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the app at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🧠 Notes

- Make sure the backend server (Spring Boot) is running on port **8080**.  
- API URLs are configured to connect to the backend REST endpoints.  
- You can update API routes or base URLs in the environment configuration if needed.
